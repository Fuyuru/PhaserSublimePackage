Sublime project with basic tern configuration for Phaser autocompletion.

Note the presence of the `.tern-project` file. There you configure the tern pugins you want to use in your project.
In this case we set the `phaser` and `doc_comments` plugins.

To use this project just rename the `phaser` folder to the name of your game and open it on Sublime Text.
